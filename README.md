# SmartAttendance ‚Äì In-Browser Attendance System

SmartAttendance is a **minimal, in-browser face recognition attendance system** built using **face-api.js**. It allows students to register their ID photos and mark attendance via webcam. The project is designed for Hacktoberfest contributions, and as a foundation for more advanced attendance solutions.

## üöÄ Features (MVP)

- **Home Page (`index.html`)** ‚Äì Overview & navigation.  
- **Register Students (`register.html`)**  
  - Upload a student ID photo to register a student.  
  - Enter **name** and **ID number** (optional for now).  
  - Detects face from the uploaded image using `face-api.js`.  
  - Prevents duplicate registrations based on face similarity.  
- **Take Attendance (`attendance.html`)**  
  - Mark attendance in real-time using webcam.  
  - Recognizes registered faces and logs attendance.  
  - Shows a list of students marked present for the current day.  
  - Export attendance as CSV.  

> **Note:** Currently, student name and ID verification against the photo is not implemented. The ID field is optional in this MVP.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Face Recognition:** [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js)  
- **Data Storage:** `localStorage` (browser-based)  
- **Optional Future Backend:** Contributors can implement MongoDB / Node.js for persistent, multi-user storage.

## üìù Usage

1. Serve the project over **HTTP(S)** (Chrome blocks webcam & model requests on `file://`).  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Go to **Register** page to register students with their ID photo.  
4. Go to **Attendance** page to mark attendance using webcam.  
5. Export attendance as CSV if needed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations (Current MVP)

- Attendance recognition sometimes shows **"Unknown Face"** due to lighting or camera issues.  
- Student name and ID are **not verified against the uploaded photo**.  
- Data is **stored only in localStorage**, so multi-browser / multi-user sync is not supported.  

---

## üéØ Future Improvements

- Integrate backend (MongoDB/Express) for persistent multi-user attendance logs.  
- Use OCR to verify ID numbers and names.  
- Improve recognition thresholds and lighting robustness.  
- Better UI/UX for registered students, attendance logs, and notifications.  
- Mobile support and multi-device recognition.
